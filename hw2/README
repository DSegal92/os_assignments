1. You would not normally implement mergesort as was done in this assignment because it would be
massively impractical for any message longer than a few dozen characters. A computer has a finite
default number of processes and any particularly message would cross this. Also, a piping and fork
based solution is inherently more error susceptible than traditional merge sort methods.
