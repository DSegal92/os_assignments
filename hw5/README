No special instructions for running this program. Just run ./main, and it will randomly
create 15 atoms, which should theoretically yield 5 bonds. 

When I attempted to run this code on the linab4 server it told me that there were no more 
sempahores. That seemed ominous and I didn't have time to contact anybody about getting 
that fixed, but it runs fine locally.

Output (For some reason I could not get the line indicating a bond to print to the console, 
but I have added it here just for clarity.)
